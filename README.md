# StealthBot
StealthBot by Stealthy. Not supported at present, but was a complete functional .NET bot using ISXEVE.


To compile you have to add a refrence to ISXEVEWrapper.dll to StealthBot Application or it will not compile, ISXEVEWrapper.dll can be found in your InnerSpace\.Net Programs\ folder. Some IDEs require you to open each file that refrences EVE if you tried to compile before refrencing the ISXEVEWrapper to update that EVE is a valid refrence.
